We are now adding a Picture card flow that parallels the queue cards we designed earlier. The Picture button should post a card per generated image set that includes the multi-caption view and an exit control labeled "Hide", so it follows the same card lifecycle and deletion behavior as the queue cards. The card shows multi-caption media at the top and adds a bottom-row button to delete the card, cleaning up all related messages. Lifecycle management can simply delete all existing picture/result messages in the chat before re-rendering so we never need to track message IDs individually. Record this prompt for future use with higher-capacity models.
