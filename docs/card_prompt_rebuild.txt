Rebuild the card infrastructure so every card type (picture, queue, preset, etc.) registers the specific `message_id`s it posts and cleans them up via a shared registry. Each card should call a helper like `_register_card_messages(chat_id, card_type, message_ids)` when posting, and deletions should rely solely on that registry. Log every `delete_message` failure instead of swallowing it, and never fall back to Telethon-derived message IDs.

Overhaul the “🖼️ Bilder” button to read from the unified `image_entries` table (file_id + caption + hash) that now stores both cached descriptions and card records, upload fresh cards only when needed, and normalize captions so only the actual description appears (no `[Picture Card]` metadata). Tail messages should simply repeat the parsed caption text, and every uploaded message must be registered with the new card registry. The image button should indicate availability (disable when no cached images) and trigger the new cleanup helper upon “Löschen.”  
The user card (scan step) must preload and cache profile pictures/file_ids during the scan, then render only from those cached `file_id`s—no fallback uploads should ever be performed from the user card itself.
