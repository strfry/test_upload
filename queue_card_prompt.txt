Starting point: We want a Card for each generated suggestion. The Card should show the queue visualization (as we currently show on the user card) and provide buttons to inspect all parts of that reply. The bottom row must include a "Queue" button that enqueues the actions from this suggestion. The user card features a "Show Queue" button that creates the same cards, but with a delete option to remove them from the queue. Every card has a "Hide Queue" button that removes the queue cards from the chat. After clicking "Show Queue" on the user card, a "Hide Queue" button appears there too; pressing "Show Queue" on any other user card deletes the existing queue/result cards. It is sufficient to delete and re-render the entire chat when reordering these cards—no need to track cards individually. Store this prompt for possible re-use with a stronger model.
